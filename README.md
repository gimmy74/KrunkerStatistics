# KrunkerStatistics

A **js discord bot** written for node.js that aims to help Krunker players in assessing their performance in game.

## What does it do?
For now the bot does... well, nothing useful. Uhhh, you can roll a dice with it? XD

I'm still heavily developing the bot and it's functionality, so don't expect things to come out straight away. I also still am not quite sure what kind of feedback users will get about their stats, how often the bot will sample data, and a lot more details still need refining!

## Dependancies
Obviously it uses the ever so popular [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) js module for interacting with Discords Official API, and it also uses fasetto's amazing (unofficial) [Krunker API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fasetto/krunker.io) with which without the idea would never be able to become a reality!

## Installation
Yeah... nah.

## Contribution
Try and find as many ways as possible you can break it, and report a bug here in GitHub!
