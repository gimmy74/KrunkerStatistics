# KrunkerStatistics

A **js discord bot** written for node.js that aims to help Krunker players in assessing their performance in game.

## What does it do?
For now it only has some very basic functionality, which includes:
- >krunker <user>, fetch the krunker stats of a user 

## Dependancies
Obviously it uses the ever so popular [discord.js]() js module for interacting with Discords Official API, and it also uses fasetto's amazing (unofficial) [Krunker API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fasetto/krunker.io) with which without the idea would never be able to become a reality!

## Instalation
Yeah... nah.

## Contribution
Try and find as many ways as possible you can break it, and report a bug here in GitHub!
